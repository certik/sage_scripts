# This is an example of a 'profile' file which includes a base file and adds
# some customizaton for a particular purpose.

# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as ipythonrc-scipy,
# it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile scipy' (or '-p scipy')
# option to IPython.

# This example is meant to load several modules to turn ipython into a very
# capable environment for high-end numerical work, similar to IDL or MatLab
# but with the beauty of the Python language.

# load our basic configuration with generic options
include ipythonrc

# import ...
# Load SciPy by itself so that 'help scipy' works
import_mod scipy

# from ... import ...
import_some

# Now we load all of SciPy
# from ... import *
import_all scipy IPython.numutils

# code 
execute print 'Welcome to the SciPy Scientific Computing Environment.'
execute scipy.alter_numeric()

# File with alternate printer system for Numeric Arrays.
# Files in the 'Extensions' directory will be found by IPython automatically
# (otherwise give the explicit path):
execfile Extensions/numeric_formats.py
